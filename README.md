I watched the Social Network and I didn't learn the moral lesson from Facemash

Setup
----------
Requires Python 2.7, Flask, Pytumblr and Flask_OAuth. Get flask, pytumblr and flask_oauth from pip.

Currently for handling API keys you have to create a json file with the structure 
````
consumer_key, consumer_secret
````
Get the consumer keys from http://www.tumblr.com/oauth/apps

Run
````
python test.py
````
and visit 127.0.0.1:5000 to use the application
